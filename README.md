rosdep is a command-line tool for installing system dependencies. For *end-users*, rosdep helps you install system dependencies for software that you are building from source. For *developers*, rosdep simplifies the problem of installing system dependencies on different platforms. Instead of having to figure out which debian package on Ubuntu Oneiric contains Boost, you can just specify a dependency on 'boost'.
